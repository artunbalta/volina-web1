CRITICAL RULES FOR SCORING (1-10 scale):
1. If caller NEVER responded or only AI spoke → score 1, outcome "no_answer"
2. If voicemail system answered OR customer said "leave me a message", "you can leave me a brief message", "leave a message", "I'll get back to you" → score 1, outcome "voicemail" (CRITICAL: "leave me a message" = voicemail, NOT a conversation)
3. If customer said "can't take your call", "can't talk", "unavailable", "busy right now", "in a meeting" → score 1-2, outcome "unavailable" (this is NOT a successful call, user is not available to engage)
4. If call lasted <15 seconds with no real conversation → score 1 or 2
5. If customer hung up immediately without engaging → score 2, outcome "not_interested"
6. If customer said "not interested", "no thanks", "don't want" AND maintained rejection throughout → MAX score 4, outcome "not_interested"
7. If customer barely spoke (only greetings like "hello", "hi") → MAX score 3
8. If customer said multiple "no" WITHOUT any positive engagement later → MAX score 5
9. If call duration <20 seconds and customer showed no interest → MAX score 4
10. If customer asked for different language (e.g., "someone speak Spanish", "speak Turkish") → MAX score 3-4 (language mismatch = not interested in current conversation)
11. If customer only gave minimal passive responses (just "okay", "hello?", "yes" without context) → MAX score 3 (no real engagement)
12. IMPORTANT: If customer initially said "no" but THEN showed positive engagement (e.g., "I'm gonna hear", "tell me more", "yeah", "open to", "considering", "finding a solution") → score 7-8 (this shows they changed their mind or are open to learning more)
13. ONLY give score 7-8 if customer showed GENUINE interest (asked questions, discussed details, engaged in conversation, OR changed their mind after initial hesitation)
14. ONLY give score 9-10 if appointment was set, sale was made, or strong commitment was given

Scoring (1-10):
- 1: No connection (voicemail, no answer, busy, only AI spoke, customer never responded, call <15 seconds)
- 2: Connected but immediately rejected (immediate hang up, "not interested" immediately, "wrong number", hostile)
- 3: Connected but minimal engagement (only greetings, barely spoke, no real conversation)
- 4: Connected but negative (said "not interested", "no thanks", declined, no engagement, call <20 seconds)
- 5: Neutral conversation (brief chat, listened but unclear interest, some "no" responses)
- 6: Neutral with some interest (listened, asked basic questions, but non-committal)
- 7: Positive interest (engaged conversation, asked questions, wants more info, showed genuine interest)
- 8: Strong interest (engaged, asked detailed questions, wants follow-up, discussed details)
- 9: Success (appointment set, callback scheduled, strong commitment, hot lead)
- 10: Great success (sale made, appointment confirmed, very strong commitment, VIP lead)

IMPORTANT:
- Be STRICT with high scores (7-10). Only give them if there's clear evidence of genuine interest or success.
- If customer said "can't take your call", "unavailable", "busy", "in a meeting" → score 1-2 (user is not available, this is NOT a successful engagement)
- If customer said "not interested" or similar AND maintained rejection throughout, NEVER give score > 4
- BUT: If customer initially said "no" but THEN showed positive engagement (e.g., "I'm gonna hear", "tell me more", "yeah", "open to", "considering"), this is POSITIVE - give score 7-8
- If call was very short (<20 seconds) and customer didn't engage, NEVER give score > 4
- If customer barely spoke (only greetings), NEVER give score > 3
- Consider call duration: very short calls (<20 seconds) cannot be highly successful
- Consider user engagement: if user said very few words, it cannot be a great call
- Pay attention to the FULL conversation: initial "no" followed by positive engagement (like "I'm gonna hear", "tell me more", "open to") indicates genuine interest - score 7-8
- NEVER give high scores (7-10) if user explicitly said they can't take the call or are unavailable - this is a failed connection, not a success

OUTCOME VALUES (choose the most appropriate):
- "appointment_set": Appointment or meeting was scheduled
- "callback_requested": Customer asked to be called back later
- "interested": Customer showed genuine interest but no commitment yet
- "not_interested": Customer explicitly declined or showed no interest
- "needs_info": Customer needs more information before deciding
- "no_answer": Customer never answered the call
- "voicemail": Call went to voicemail
- "wrong_number": Wrong number or person reached
- "busy": Line was busy or customer was unavailable

SENTIMENT VALUES:
- "positive": Customer was positive, engaged, interested
- "neutral": Customer was neutral, neither positive nor negative
- "negative": Customer was negative, hostile, or clearly not interested

TAGS (add relevant tags from this list):
- "appointment_set", "callback_requested", "follow_up_needed"
- "hot_lead", "warm_lead", "cold_lead"
- "price_concern", "timing_concern", "needs_info"
- "interested", "not_interested", "highly_interested"
